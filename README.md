# Jak Speedrunning Practice (OpenGOAL)

| Button combination | Effect | 
|-|-|
| R3 + dpad left | Get on flutflut, or get off flutflut/zoomer if already on. |
| R3 + dpad right | Get on zoomer, or get off flutflut/zoomer if already on. |
| R3 + dpad down | Set a custom checkpoint at Jak's current position (also remembers if you are on flutflut or zoomer). Only works if Jak is in an "idle" state. Plays a sound to confirm. |
| R3 + dpad up | Reset to last selected skip/trick, or to custom checkpoint, whichever was used most recently. |
| R3 + L3 | Same as R3 + dpad up, except for custom checkpoints it will also reset the entire game. |
